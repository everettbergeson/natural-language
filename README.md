So this was for one of my Applied & Computational Math classes, following a step by step process given at this link:

The process was to create an adjacency matrix for every line in the training set, and using 
  Markov chains take a walk through that matrix.
For class, we were given a "yoda.txt" file which contained every line Yoda had ever said. 
I created a "taylor.txt" file, which contains 2 albums worth of Taylor Swift songs and 
  a "trump.txt" file with 2 or 3 weeks of selectively formatted tweets from Donald Trump.
This project isn't really anything too original because of the guidelines I was given, but
  I am very proud of how it turned out and how it's usable for other things besides creating
  pretend Yoda sentences. My friends thought some of them were pretty entertaining.
