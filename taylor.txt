Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
As were lyin on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin, there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing, thats ever been mine
Flash forward, and were takin on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes
And we got bills to pay
We got nothin figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing, thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing, thats ever been mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye,
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, Ill never leave you alone
You said, I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
She is the best thing thats ever been mine.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing, thats ever been mine
Do you believe it?
Were gonna make it now
And I can see it
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something thatll haunt me whenever youre not around
Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile
My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and its really something
You find Im even better than you, imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow
And Im captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
When sparks fly oh baby smile
When sparks fly
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life, tell me hows your family?
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized Id loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marryin the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, dont you?
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, speak now
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, speak now
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres a silence, theres my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands
All eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only lookin at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin the wrong girl
So dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, speak now
And you say, lets run away now
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door
Oh baby, I didnt say my vow
So glad you were around when they said, speak now
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I shouldve known
Well maybe its me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand
And Ill look back and regret how I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I shouldve known
You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So dont look now, Im shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shouldve known, you shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young? You shouldve known
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when Im wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know
Someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down,
Try to block you out cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know
Someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobodys listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday Ill be big enough
So you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday Ill be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
I used to think one day wed tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I cant break through
Now Im standing alone In a crowded room
And were not speaking and Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter
Howd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, Im scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking and Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If youd say youd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking and Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everythings funny
You got nothing to regret
Id give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
Youre in the car on the way to the movies
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
At fourteen, theres just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Remember that shes getting older too
And dont lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no ones ever burned you
Nothings ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brothers favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
Its so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish Id never grown up
I wish Id never grown up
Oh I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up, dont you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Dont you ever grow up
Just never grow up
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered have we met?
Across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonder struck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till Im wide awake
Now Im pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonder struck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, dont you let it go
Im wonder struck, dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, dont you let it go
Im wonder struck, blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, dont you let it go
Im wonder struck, dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys on the playground
Wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks Im psycho
Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isnt what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didnt teach you that in prep school
So its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys on the playground
Wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but Ill always get the last word
Whoa
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress, whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys on the playground
Wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
And do you still feel like you know what youre doing,
Cause I dont think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
I dont think you do, I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause
Cmon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin to get it back
Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?
Its alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent
Did some things you cant speak of
But at night youll live it all again
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasnt it easier in your firefly-catchin days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?
Its alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
Youll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new
Its all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh
Its never too late to get it back
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its comin over you like its all a big mistake
Holding my breath, wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong, youre all I wanted
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back, now Im haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishin he was you instead
Oh, oh, holding my breath, wont see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong, youre all I wanted
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back, now Im haunted
I know, I know, I just know
Youre not gone, you cant be gone
No
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong, wont finish what you started
Come on, come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant go back, Im haunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away
I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you missed
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party, youre showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
Im not much for dancing
But for you I did
Because I love your handshake
Meetin my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions
And Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And Ill keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And its a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, this is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That youll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss, its flawless, really something, its fearless.
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
You take a deep breath
And you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in awhile
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year
And youre gonna be here for the next four years
In this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say, you know I havent seen you around, before
Cause when youre fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
Count to ten
Take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
At fifteen
You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who they think theyre so cool
Well be out of here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date
And hes got a car
And youre feeling like flying
And youre mamas waiting up
And youre thinking hes the one
And youre dancing around the room when the night ends
When the night ends
Cause when youre fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin around
But in your life youll do things
Greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen
When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when youre fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standin there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin pebbles
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
And I was cryin on the staircase
Beggin you, Please dont go,  and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was beggin you, Please dont go,  and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Romeo, save me, theyre tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real
Dont be afraid, well make it out of this mess
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin if you were ever comin around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, Marry me, Juliet
Youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
Its a love story, baby, just say, Yes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we would talk
And I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
Hey Stephen, Ive been holding back this feeling
So Ive got some things to say to you
Ive seen it all, so I thought
But Ive never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
Its beautiful, wonderful, dont you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
Theyre dimming the street lights, youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight?
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you?
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
I cant help myself if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
myself
Mm
I cant help myself
I cant help myself
Oh, Oh,
Mm
Mm
Say youre sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known
That Im not a princess, this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know
Im not a princess, this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry
Cause Im not your princess, this aint a fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, its too late
To catch me now
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend, shes upset
Shes goin off about somethin that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in the room, its a typical Tuesday night
Im listenin to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
Shes cheer captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreamin bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walkin the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I cant help thinkin this is how it ought to be
Laughin on a park bench, thinkin to myself
Hey, isnt this easy?
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreamin bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standin by and waitin at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you drivin to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standin by and waitin at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie,
Its the kinda ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down,
Now I dont know what to be without you around
And we know its never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
And I cant,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people,
And sometimes it doesnt work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know its never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
And I cant,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to
Its two am
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy,
Easy for me
Its two am
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy,
Easy for me
And we know its never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
I cant,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to
Sorry (oh) sorry
Sorry sorry
Sorry sorry
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof, but Im not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say, oh
Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why
Why, do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why, do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind
Well Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why
I take a step back, let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And its taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again
But not this time around
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry, no no, no no
Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life
If you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before
But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry, no no
Youre not sorry, no no
You had me crawling for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before youre not sorry
No, no, no
Youre not sorry, no no (no)
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screamin and fightin
And kissin in the rain
And its two a.m. and Im cursin your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breakin down and comin undone
Its a roller-coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He respects my space and never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing, and Im comfortable
But I miss screamin and fightin
And kissin in the rain
And its two a.m. and Im cursin your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breakin down and comin undone
Its a roller-coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He cant see the smile Im fakin
And my hearts not breakin
Cause Im not feelin anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
Ill be screamin and fightin
And kissin in the rain
Its two a.m. and Im cursin your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breakin down and comin undone
Its a roller-coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
And thats the way I loved you
I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect, now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I dont anymore
And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby, I dont think so
Oh back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby,
You said forever and always, yeah.
Im five years old
Its getting cold
Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
Im thirteen now
And dont know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys
And we drive and drive
Until we find a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
Till I forgotten all their names
I dont know who Im gonna talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing
On the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And Ive got space to run and hide
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And, I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.
And its a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Its a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Its a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
Tonight well stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
